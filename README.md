# React/Dotnet Project - UI

This project will be a result of a Udemy course, which a I choose to help me learn more about how to build an API using .NET Core that will be consumed by a front end application.  
For front end, it will use React, which is a framework that I am familiar with, because I already use at work.
So, short story, this is a study project from a front end dev that is trying to learn more about back end.
